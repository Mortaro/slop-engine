# 3D: scenes, characters and lighting

Built and tested by `examples/kal_character`: a Kal archer read straight from its `.blend`. It is skinned, textured
and animated, lit by the sun, sky and fog, casts a shadow and is tone mapped, with no Blender install and no
exporter. Everything is split into plugins, so a game loads only what it uses and can replace any piece.

The Kal assets are not in this repository. The example reads them from `D:/Projects/kal-assets`; point it elsewhere
with `spite kal_character --kal_assets=<folder>`.

| Plugin | Namespace | What it brings |
|---|---|---|
| `slop_transform_plugin` | `Transform` | `Transform.Component.Transform`: position, a rotation quaternion and scale |
| `slop_camera_plugin` | `Camera` | `Camera.Component.Camera` (eye, target, field of view, near, far) and `Camera.Component.Orbit` with the `AimOrbit` system |
| `slop_scene_plugin` | `Scene` | `Scene.Component.Model` (a mesh id and a bone palette); `Scene.Component.View` and `Scene.Component.Meshes` on each window; `Gather` collects the camera, the models and the lighting every frame |
| `slop_scene_vulkan_plugin` | `SceneVulkan` | the Vulkan passes: sun shadow map, lit scene into HDR, tone map into the frame, then the UI draws on top |
| `slop_animation_plugin` | `Animation` | `Animation.Component.Animator` (skeleton, clip, time, speed, looping); `Animate` samples the clip into the model's palette |
| `slop_lighting_plugin` | `Lighting` | `Sun`, `Sky`, `HeightFog` and `Exposure` components and a `Daylight` bundle, written into each view |
| `slop_blend_plugin` | `Blend` | `MeshReader`, `SkeletonReader` and `ActionReader`: what a recipe needs from a `.blend` |
| `slop_png_plugin` | `Png` | a PNG decoder, pixel-exact against Pillow, for the images packed in a `.blend` |

`slop/` itself gains only neutral pieces:
- the assets: `Asset.Mesh`, `Asset.Skeleton` and `Asset.Animation`;
- `Recipes.AssetSlots<T>`, which loads any cooked asset on the thread pool;
- the maths: `Math.Scalar`, `Math.Matrix4`, `Math.Pose` and `Math.Vector3`.

## A character is cooked by a recipe

`kal_character/recipe/archer.spite` opens `archer.blend` once, then cooks:
- the skeleton from the `rig` armature;
- the outfit's parts, each `Body - <part>` object into `archer.body.<part>`;
- each part's packed PNG into `archer.texture.<image>`;
- the `Idle`, `Walk` and `Run` actions into `archer.animation.<clip>`.

A recipe is plain Spite, so choosing parts, naming ids and grouping outfits belong to the game, not to the loader.
The whole archer (65 bones, seven parts, three clips) cooks in about 5.5 s, 4.3 s of which is decompressing the
zstd `.blend`, and only when the file's size or modification time changes.

What the readers do:

- **Pointers are resolved within the ID being read.** Blender 5 reuses pointer values across data-blocks, so a
  reader enters the ID it reads (`file.enter(view)`) and duplicate addresses resolve to that ID's blocks.
- **Meshes.** Blender 5 keeps geometry in `AttributeStorage`: `position`, `.corner_vert`, the active UV map and
  `sharp_face`. Each attribute's data sits behind an `AttributeArray`.
  - Faces are triangulated as fans.
  - Normals are smooth, or the face normal where `sharp_face` is set.
  - Corners are welded by vertex, normal and UV.
  - Positions go through the object's world matrix and from Blender's Z-up to Y-up, `(x, y, z) → (x, z, -y)`.
  - Skin weights come from the deform-vertex layer of the vertex data: the four heaviest groups that name a
    bone, renormalised.
  - The texture is the first image-texture node's packed file.
- **Skeletons.** Bones are ordered so parents come first. The inverse bind is
  `(to_target · armature_world · arm_mat · to_source)⁻¹`.
- **Actions.** Layered actions (layers, strips, channel bags) and legacy `curves` are both read.
  - Location, quaternion rotation and scale F-curves are evaluated at every whole frame: constant, linear, and
    bezier through a cubic solved for the frame.
  - Each frame is posed in Blender's armature space: `pose[parent] · rest[parent]⁻¹ · rest · basis`.
  - The pose is moved to engine space and stored as the parent-relative position, rotation and scale.

## Animation

`Animate` advances each animator by the real elapsed time and samples its clip.
- Position and scale are interpolated linearly.
- Rotation uses a shortest-arc slerp, falling back to a normalised lerp for near-identical keys.
- It writes `global · inverse_bind` for each bone into `Scene.Component.Model.palette`.

The scene plugin knows nothing of animation: it uploads any palette a model carries, and the vertex shader skins
with four bones per vertex.

## Lighting

The scene pass writes pre-exposed radiance into an RGBA16F image. The maths:
- **Specular:** GGX distribution, height-correlated Smith visibility, Schlick Fresnel with grazing reflectance.
- **Diffuse:** Lambert.
- **Material:** a painted default of roughness 0.7, specular 0.5, metallic 0.
- **Ambient:** a sky and ground hemisphere.
- **Fog:** exponential height fog by its optical depth along the view ray.
- **Exposure:** `1 / (1.2 · 2^EV100)`, with EV100 15 by default.

A full-screen pass tone maps with the ACES fit, encodes sRGB and dithers into the frame, under the UI.

The sun casts a 2048² shadow map:
- an orthographic view around the camera's target, with the depth-only pipeline sharing the skinning vertex
  shader and keeping alpha cut-outs;
- a slope-scaled depth bias against acne;
- 3×3 PCF when sampling.

Cut-out texels (alpha below 0.5) are discarded in every pass.

Lighting data lives on the neutral `Scene.View` with daylight defaults. The lighting plugin only overwrites it from
components, so a scene without that plugin is still lit.

## Not built yet

These are what the previous Kal renderer had:
- the ray-marched atmosphere and sky;
- shadow cascades and contact shadows;
- GTAO;
- clustered point and spot lights;
- image-based sky lighting;
- bloom;
- 4× MSAA;
- automatic exposure from a histogram;
- mipmaps and anisotropic filtering for scene textures;
- Blender's custom split normals (`custom_normal` is ignored and normals are recomputed);
- blending between clips.
